Coding is always fun at [Wingify](https://wingify.com/), be it a Wingify Camp or a Fun Friday. And to add to the fun, in a Fun Friday [Code In the Dark](http://codeinthedark.com/) was organized by Wingify on 15th April 2016 in both Wingify's Delhi and Pune office. The event is a front-end (HTML, CSS) competition created by the folks at [Tictail](https://tictail.com/), where each contestant compete to implement a website design given only a screenshot. The catch is, no previews of the results are allowed during the implementation, and no measuring tools can be used. There are some simple rules of the event:

* Duration: 15 min
* Technology: HTML/CSS
* No previews
* One champion

The event started at 5 o'clock in the evening and was divided into two slots, each slot having 9 participants. The rule was to choose two from each slot so that final four compete in the final round. Along with that, to add to the fun and frolic, a loud music was played to motivate the contestants to write the code as fast as they can. The lights were turned off to create an awesome atmosphere to complement the theme of the event. The only light flashing was that of TV and Laptop screens which added a magical appearance to the room.
