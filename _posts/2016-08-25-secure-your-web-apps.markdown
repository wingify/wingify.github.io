Recently, I spoke about securing Web Applications at [JSChannel Conference â€™16][1]. The conference venue was The Ritz-Carlton, Bangalore.
JSChannel is a great conference to attend and to connect with some great people. And when I say great, I literally mean it. We met with Yehuda Katz (one of the creators of Ember.js), Lea Verou (Expert in the W3C CSS Working Group) & Christian Lilley (Father of SVG) and experts from McKinsey.

Three Wingifighters flew to attend and listen to this amazing conference and here we are, showing off some swag.ðŸ¤˜

Day 1 was amazing. Rachit, having attended almost all the sessions, has shared his learning experience at the conference on the [Team Wingifyâ€™s Space][2].

### Before The Talk

Speaking at a conference involves a lot of work before getting on stage. Preparation is crucial. I spent a good number of hours to jot down a list of security vulnerabilities to talk about and steps to mitigate them. I had to make sure none of my demonstrations exposed the vulnerabilities of the websites I chose to talk about.

And guess what, in my preparation for the demo, I actually found another way to bypass a previously reported vulnerability in time just before the conference.
Keeping in mind the JavaScript conference and the audience, I made sure everything was related to Browser level and Node.js application attacks.

### The Talk

It all started with a humorous introduction and a show of my prowess!

> Security is like the elephant in the room where everyone agrees that it's very important but only a few take it very seriously.

I touched upon the recent Github reused password attack and why we should follow a good password hygiene and move towards multi-factor authentication (MFA).

#### XSS

**Rule of thumb**: Validate input and escape output

#### CSRF

XSS + CSRF = Game Over!

I've developed a sample web application using Node.js, Express and Angular that is vulnerable to common security vulnerabilities were demonstrated. <a href='https://github.com/djadmin/vulnerable-app' target='_blank'>Click here to see the code.</a>

#### What could possibly go wrong?

The talk ended with a live demonstration of an interesting and serious vulnerability found on a popular hiring platform, RecruiterBox. A JavaScript injection using which an attacker can upload a maliciously crafted resume and can perform Cross-site Scripting attacks. I used Burp Suite, an interceptor proxy to bypass the fix deployed by Recruiterbox, for demonstration purposes.

### Feedback:

After the talk, it was rewarding to see a good response and interesting queries from the audience. One comment I received from audience was "We have just realized that our services are vulnerable to one of the attacks you have demonstrated and we never gave a thought to it. Thank you!".

__My 2 cents for attending any tech conference__

More than the talks themselves, it is the people that you should attend the conference for. You should meet the other attendees! If a particular talk is interesting and useful then you can and should talk to the speaker.

__Key takeaways:__

1.  Never blindly trust user input.
2.  Always use proven sanitizers and tools.
3.  Perform security audits.
4.  Keep discussing vulnerabilities because the Internet has a bunch of weird old stuff that, not necessarily, every software developer knows about.


#### Video.

As a first-time speaker, I wasnâ€™t sure what to expect. It turned out to be a great experience and received very positive feedback.
