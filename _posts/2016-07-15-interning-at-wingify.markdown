In May this year, I started my internship at [Wingify][1], and they just crushed my old belief of internships! This was my first time interning at a big company like Wingify and I have never learned as much in 2 months. Before joining as an intern, I had offers for internship and I was very confused about which one to join. At last, after discussing it with my seniors, I joined ***Wingify*** and, now, I think it was the right decision. This is a revoluntionized place. The culture and the environment gives you new enthusiasm to towards your work or should I say, the chilling environment of the office can make even a depressed person get the best out of himself, though I am not :P.


I was the first intern to start here, this summer, followed by twelve more interns. On the first day at work place, I reached at 10:00 a.m. as I was not aware of the flexible timings. After a while, the HR came to my seat and introduced me with my mentor. And within a short period of time, people were talking with me very frankly as if I had beeen working for them for quite a while.


My work here mainly included ***Backend Development*** and ***VWO Chrome Extension Development***. In [VWO][2] App, they provide a feature called **Plan** to users, in which a user can create Observations for their tests and can attach Hypotheses to the observations. In this, I was given the task of building a feature which could upload multiple hypotheses and observations simultaneously which will solve the problem of creating one hypothesis and observation at a single time. This in turn, would provide user a nice planning experience and also let him import his existing data to the feature. I also worked on the VWO Chrome Extension with no experience in extensions development.

Apart from work, there were quite many activities like monthly ***Hackathons***, ***Company Camp***, ***Wingify Talkies*** and much more, which easily attracts all the enthusiastic techies.  

The atmosphere is so exciting and cool or I should say they made it. Also, in the shadow of huge experienced people, one can learn and explore any technology right from the beginning. But the best part of it was not only the work, it was about party, jokes and importantly being friendly towards your colleagues and passionate about your work. This place and internship taught how to be you and know your within potential.

The most satisfying thing about the internship was that I was fully involved in the company's operations and not treated separately, like interns elsewhere. The learning experience I earned owing to this was invaluable. I picked up a lot of things in relatively short time, and gained valuable insights into not only our own sector, but also the other sectors. I got considerable exposure and, now, well equipped to make a decision on how to proceed from here onwards.

Interning with Wingify was a wonderful learning experience. It is a great place to work and party hard \m/.
