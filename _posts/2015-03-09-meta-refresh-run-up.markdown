[Meta Refresh][2] is an event organised by HasGeek that focuses on design, user experience and the front-end web. The current iteration of Meta Refresh (2015) will be held in Bangalore on April 17.

[Wingify][7] will be hosting the [Delhi run-up event][3] for Meta Refresh. The session will focus on how designers, engineers, optimization specialists and businesses can use data (statistics) to drive design opinion, thereby optimizing their websites and web applications. The premise being that the data speaks for itself at any point of time, and provides you with validations or rejections on your hypothesis. A data-centric approach towards web-design serves the same cause. The design / layout of any website is based on certain intuitions of the designer, and many a times there is a conflict of interests between the designer and the business team. How about tweaking the website to bridge the gap between design and business?

If this is a topic that interests you we encourage you to join us for the run-up event on March 21 at our office. It would be a great opportunity for you to:

1. **Speak** - If you have a similar topic in mind, or even a different one that goes with the theme of Meta Refresh 2015 (*web in your pockets*), [propose a session at the talk funnel][3].
2. **Learn** - [RSVP for the event][3] at the same link and be present for the event to learn from the community.
3. **Interact** - Mingle and chat with us and other attendees about design, usability, or anything at all.

We look forward to seeing you at the event!
