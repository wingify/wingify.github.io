A part of <a href=\"http://2014.devfest.asia/\">DevFest Asia</a>, it is the best way to meet and connect with front-end designers and developers in South East Asia. It was the first time CSSConf was happening in Asia, and our own <a href=\"http://twitter.com/chinchang457\">Kushagra Gour</a> had the opportunity to speak at it. He talked about <em><a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/chinchang/10-commandments-for-efficient-css-architecture-cssconf-dot-asia-14\">10 Commandments for efficient CSS architecture</a></em>. The conference venue was Hotel Amara Sanctuary, on the island of Sentosa, Singapore.</p>\n<h2 id=\"cssconf\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#cssconf\" aria-label=\"cssconf permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>CSSConf</h2>\n<p>The day began with boarding the MRT and the Sentosa Express to get to the venue, and meanwhile being mesmerized by the marvelous Singaporean skyscrapers. A sip of coffee at the <a href=\"http://www.jimmymonkey.com/\">Jimmy Monkey Cafe</a> made our eyes open wide, and began <a href=\"https://twitter.com/serrynaimo\">Thomas</a>' introduction to Asia's first CSSConf. It is commendable for a small bunch of people to organize conferences for the community at such large scale, working part time.</p>\n<p>The quality of the talks at the conference was way above our expectations for a first-time event. The speakers and the topics they spoke about were pretty interesting. Below are the talks that I found really intriguing, and I recommend everyone to go through the videos and slides for them:</p>\n<h3 id=\"no-more-tools-by-karolina-szczur\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#no-more-tools-by-karolina-szczur\" aria-label=\"no more tools by karolina szczur permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UKrEfkiNZE\">No More Tools</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/fox\">Karolina Szczur</a></h3>\n<p>Her talk made an interesting point: with all the rapid development happening in the front-end realm, we're making use of tools more than ever, which when mixed with biases and preferences, do more harm than good. She explained what puts apart good tools from the bad ones, and the telltale signs of a tool doing more harm than good.</p>\n<h3 id=\"build-scalable-automated-css-both-you-and-your-back-end-coders-can-love-by-christian-lilley\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#build-scalable-automated-css-both-you-and-your-back-end-coders-can-love-by-christian-lilley\" aria-label=\"build scalable automated css both you and your back end coders can love by christian lilley permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tk_0qYEFtAY\">Build Scalable, Automated CSS Both You and Your ’Back-End’ Coders Can Love</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/xmlilley\">Christian Lilley</a></h3>\n<p>As front-end developers, we have been conditioned to live and breathe CSS, both good and bad parts, beckoning a love-hate relationship with it. But it is rather cumbersome for someone new coming in ease into the concept of cascading style sheets, and that coupled with misused practices makes people think of CSS as some sort of dark magic. Christian's talk separates the good parts from the bad ones, and points the listeners into a direction everyone can take to make CSS a language everyone can love.</p>\n<h3 id=\"inside-the-airbnb-brand-evolution-by-fiona-tey\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#inside-the-airbnb-brand-evolution-by-fiona-tey\" aria-label=\"inside the airbnb brand evolution by fiona tey permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://speakerdeck.com/fionatay/inside-the-airbnb-brand-evolution\">Inside the AirBnB brand evolution</a> by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MsFionaTay\">Fiona Tey</a></h3>\n<p>AirBnB's product is so simple, yet efficient to use, especially their mobile app that it makes you feel a sense of satisfaction competing products or even luxurious hotels couldn't match.

Recall a time when that wasn't really the question? Ben's talk took the listeners on a nostalgic ride to the years of hacking around and creating things from the past. Recall spending nights working on creating things as the first ray of sun hits the window, the pride of showing around your project in your peer group, hours upon hours of creative brainstorming to build something exciting? Ben extracts out the secret sauce for that feeling of happiness that stems from creating something and how to hold on to it to keep treading that road.</p>\n<img src=\"/images/2015/01/ben.jpg\">\n<p><em>Words of Wisdom</em></p>\n<h2 id=\"jsconf\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#jsconf\" aria-label=\"jsconf permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>JSConf</h2>\n<p>JSConf had multitude of interesting talks.
