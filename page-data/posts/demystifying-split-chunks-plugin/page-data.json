So, our goal was specifically to decrease the bundle size and utilize a better code splitting mechanism in the app.</p>\n<p>Our Webpack configuration file looks like this:</p>\n<p>{% highlight js %}\n// Filename: webpack.config.js</p>\n<p>const webpack = require('webpack');\nmodule.exports = {\n//...\noptimization: {\nsplitChunks: {\nchunks: 'all'\n}\n}\n};\n{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>We used <a href=\"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/webpack-bundle-analyzer\">webpack-bundle-analyzer</a> to get a nice view of our problem.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/2018/08/split-chunks-duplicated-view.png\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"observation\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#observation\" aria-label=\"observation permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Observation</h3>\n<p>By default, Split Chunks plugin only affects on-demand chunks and it split chunks based on following <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/#defaults\">conditions</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>A new chunk should be shared or containing modules should be from the node_modules folder.</li>\n<li>New chunk should be bigger than 30 KB.</li>\n<li>Maximum number of parallel requests when loading chunks on demand should be lower or equal to 5.</li>\n<li>Maximum number of parallel requests at initial page load should be lower or equal to 3.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In our case, a separate chunk of the large-sized library would not be created.</p>\n<p><strong>What's the reasoning behind this?</strong></p>\n<p>It satisfies first and second conditions as it is being used in 4 chunks and its size (550 KB) is bigger than 30 KB so concludes that it should be in a new chunk. But it does not satisfy the third one as 5 chunks were already created at each dynamic import which is the maximum limit for async requests. We observed that the first 4 chunks include all modules which are shared among 7,6,5,5 async chunks respectively and the last one is its own chunk. Modules on which a maximum number of async chunks are dependent on have been given priority and as a library is required by only 4 async chunks, a chunk containing it would not be created.</p>\n<p>When we run <code class=\"language-text\">yarn build</code> to build our assets, a chunk named <strong>vendors~async.chunk.1~async.chunk.2~async.chunk.3~async.chunk.4</strong> is not found in the output:</p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/2018/08/split-chunks-default-build-view-1.png\"></p>\n<p><img src=\"/images/2018/08/split-chunks-default-build-view-2.png\"></p>\n<h3 id=\"solutions\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#solutions\" aria-label=\"solutions permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Solutions</h3>\n<p>We can have more control over this functionality. We can change default configuration in either or combination of the following ways:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Increasing <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/#splitchunks-maxasyncrequests\">maxAsyncRequests</a> result in more chunks. A large number of requests degrades the performance but it's not a concern in HTTP/2 because of the <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/performance/http2/\">request and response multiplexing</a>. So, this configuration should be preferred in case of HTTP/2 only.</p>\n<p>Now let’s take a look at Webpack configuration file after this change:</p>\n<p>{% highlight js %}\n// Filename: webpack.config.js</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">const webpack = require(&#39;webpack&#39;);\nmodule.exports = {\n    //...\n   optimization: {\n      splitChunks: {\n         chunks: &#39;all&#39;,\n         maxAsyncRequests: 20\n      }\n   }\n};</code></pre></div>\n<p>{% endhighlight %}</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Increasing <a href=\"https://webpack.js.org/plugins/split-chunks-plugin/#splitchunks-minsize\">minSize</a> also gives the desired result. Some modules with higher usage in our app and size less than minSize would not be included in separate chunks as they all violate the second condition like in case of minSize 100 KB, modules greater than 100 KB are considered giving more possibilities for creating chunks containing large-sized modules.</p>\n<p>Now let’s take a look at Webpack configuration file after this change:</p>\n<p> {% highlight js %}\n// Filename: webpack.config.js</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">const webpack = require(&#39;webpack&#39;);\nmodule.exports = {\n    //...\n   optimization: {\n      splitChunks: {\n         chunks: &#39;all&#39;,\n         minSize: 100000\n      }\n   }\n};</code></pre></div>\n<p> {% endhighlight %}</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 id=\"experiment\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#experiment\" aria-label=\"experiment permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Experiment</h3>\n<p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>\n<ol>\n<li>We picked any two async chunks between which a large-sized third-party library (550 KB) is shared.

Loading multiple small chunks increases the loading time of page but with HTTP/2, it will work efficiently.</p>\n<p>Finally, we achieved what we wanted, a big library is now separated from our bundles and lazy loaded on demand.
