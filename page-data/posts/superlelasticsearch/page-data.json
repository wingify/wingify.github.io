So the amount of data getting stored in Elasticsearch is tied\nup to the number of campaigns currently being run by our customers. And often\nwe need to have custom tooling to work with this data and the requirements of\nsuch tooling are also not common. This blog post is about how we solved some\nissues by building some missing blocks in the\n<a href=\"https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch-py\">Official Elasticsearch Python</a> client while working on this project.</p>\n<p>The code base where implementation of this feature (Post Report Segmentation)\nlies is all written in Python. When we were starting out, we had to decide\nwhich client to use because there were many out there. Eliminating some was\nreally easy because they were tied to certain frameworks like <a href=\"http://www.tornadoweb.org/en/stable/guide.html\">Tornado</a>\nand <a href=\"https://twistedmatrix.com/trac/\">Twisted</a>. And we were not sure which path to take initially so we\ndecided to keep things simple, avoid early optimization and not use any of\nthese framework heavily dependent on Non-Blocking IO. If we needed any of that\nlater, Gevent could be put to use (in fact that’s exactly what we did). Even\nfor the simpler way there were quite a few options. The deciding factors for\nus were:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Maintenance commitment from the author</li>\n<li>Un-opinionated</li>\n<li>Simple design</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Considering all these factors, we decided to go with the Official Python\nClient for Elasticsearch. And we didn't really come across any issues and\nproblems according to our simple requirements. It is fairly extensible and\ncomes with some standard batteries included with it. For everything else, you\ncan extend it - thanks to its simple design.</p>\n<p>It worked well for a while until we had to add some internal tooling where we\nneeded to work a lot with Elasticsearch's <a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/search-request-scroll.html\">Scroll API</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/1.4/docs-bulk.html\">Bulk APIs</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"bulk-api\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#bulk-api\" aria-label=\"bulk api permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Bulk API</h2>\n<p>Elasticsearch's Bulk API lets you club together multiple individual API calls\ninto one. This is used a lot in speeding up indexing and can be very useful if\nyou are doing a lot of write operations in Elasticsearch.</p>\n<p>The way you work with Bulk APIs is that you\nconstruct a different kind of request body for bulk requests and use the client\nfor sending that request data. The HTTP API that Elasticsearch exposes for bulk\noperations is semantically different than the API for individual operations.</p>\n<p>Consider this. If you were to index a new document, update an existing document\nand delete another existing document in Elasticsearch, you can do it like so:</p>\n<p>{% highlight python %}\nfrom elasticsearch import Elasticsearch</p>\n<p>client = Elasticsearch(hosts=['localhost:9200'])\nclient.index(index='test<em>index</em>1', doc<em>type='test</em>doc<em>type',\nbody=dict(key1='val1'))\nclient.update(index='test</em>index<em>3', doc</em>type='test<em>doc</em>type',\nid=456, body={\n'script': 'ctx.<em>source.count += count',\n'params': {\n'count': 1\n}\n})\nclient.delete(index='test</em>index<em>2', doc</em>type='test<em>doc</em>type',\nid=123)\n{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>If you were to achieve the same thing using Bulk APIs, you would end up writing\ncode like this:</p>\n<p>{% highlight python %}\nfrom elasticsearch import Elasticsearch</p>\n<p>client = Elasticsearch(hosts=['localhost:9200'])</p>\n<p>bulk_body = ''</p>\n<h1 id=\"index-operation-body\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#index-operation-body\" aria-label=\"index operation body permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>index operation body</h1>\n<p>bulk<em>body += '{ \"index\" : { \"</em>index\" : \"test<em>index</em>1\", \"<em>type\" : \"test</em>doc<em>type\", \"</em>id\" : \"1\" } }\\n'\nbulk_body += '{ \"key1\": \"val1\" }\\n'</p>\n<h1 id=\"update-operation-body\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#update-operation-body\" aria-label=\"update operation body permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>update operation body</h1>\n<p>bulk<em>body += '{ \"update\" : {\"</em>id\" : \"456\", \"<em>index\" : \"test</em>index<em>3\", \"</em>type\" : \"test<em>doc</em>type\"} }\\n'\nbulk<em>body += '{ \"script\": \"ctx.</em>source.count += count\", \"params\": { \"count\": 1 } }\\n'</p>\n<h1 id=\"delete-operation-body\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#delete-operation-body\" aria-label=\"delete operation body permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>delete operation body</h1>\n<p>bulk<em>body += '{ \"delete\" : { \"</em>index\" : \"test<em>index</em>2\", \"<em>type\" : \"test</em>doc<em>type\", \"</em>id\" : \"123\" } }'</p>\n<h1 id=\"finally-make-the-request\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#finally-make-the-request\" aria-label=\"finally make the request permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>finally, make the request</h1>\n<p>client.bulk(body=bulk_body)\n{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>There is a ton of difference in how bulk operations work on the code and API\nlevel as compared to individual operations.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The request body is considerably different in Bulk APIs as compared to their\nindividual APIs.</li>\n<li>The responsibility of properly serializing request body is now shifted to\nthe developer whereas this can be handled at the client level.</li>\n<li>Serialization format itself is a mixup of JSON and new-line character\nseparated string.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If you are depending a lot on bulk operations, these problems will bite you when\nyou start using it at a lot of places in your code.

You have to keep <code class=\"language-text\">scroll_id</code> after every iteration to get the next set\nof documents. Depending upon your application, there is probably no work\naround. However, our use-case was to get a large number of documents all\ntogether. You can do that without Scroll API as well i.e. by using the size\nparameter where you can tell Elasticsearch how many documents to return and you\ncan ask it to return all documents by using the Count Search API first and then\npassing the size, but that will usually time out (or at least it did for us).\nSo what we did was scroll Elasticsearch in a loop and do the book keeping in\nthe code. And that was simple as well until we had to do it at multiple places</p>\n<ul>\n<li>there was no uniform way to do that and a lot of code repetition was done as\nwell.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Our solution to this problem was to create a separate wrapper API only for this\npurpose and use that everywhere in our project. So we wrote a simple function\nthat would do the book-keeping for us and it could be used like so:</p>\n<p>{% highlight python %}\ndef scrolled_search(es, scroll, *args, **kwargs):\n'''\nIterator for Elasticsearch Scroll API.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"text\"><pre class=\"language-text\"><code class=\"language-text\">:param es: Elasticsearch client object\n:param str scroll: scroll expiry time according to Elasticsearch Scroll API\n                   docs\n\n...
