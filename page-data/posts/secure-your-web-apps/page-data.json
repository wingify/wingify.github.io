Preparation is crucial. I spent a good number of hours to jot down a list of security vulnerabilities to talk about and steps to mitigate them. I had to make sure none of my demonstrations exposed the vulnerabilities of the websites I chose to talk about.</p>\n<p>And guess what, in my preparation for the demo, I actually found another way to bypass a previously reported vulnerability in time just before the conference.\nKeeping in mind the JavaScript conference and the audience, I made sure everything was related to Browser level and Node.js application attacks.</p>\n<h3 id=\"the-talk\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-talk\" aria-label=\"the talk permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The Talk</h3>\n<div style=\"width: 100%\">\n    <script async class=\"speakerdeck-embed\" data-id=\"73bbddb59072472a88de3b22005089f1\" data-ratio=\"1.77777777777778\" src=\"//speakerdeck.com/assets/embed.js\"></script>\n    <p>For the video, scroll down to the end of the post.</p>\n</div>\n<p>It all started with a humorous introduction and a show of my prowess!</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Security is like the elephant in the room where everyone agrees that it's very important but only a few take it very seriously.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I touched upon the recent Github reused password attack and why we should follow a good password hygiene and move towards multi-factor authentication (MFA).</p>\n<h4 id=\"xss\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#xss\" aria-label=\"xss permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>XSS</h4>\n<img src=\"/images/2016/08/jschannel_xss.jpeg\">\n<p><strong>Rule of thumb</strong>: Validate input and escape output</p>\n<h4 id=\"csrf\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#csrf\" aria-label=\"csrf permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>CSRF</h4>\n<p>XSS + CSRF = Game Over!</p>\n<p>I've developed a sample web application using Node.js, Express and Angular that is vulnerable to common security vulnerabilities were demonstrated. <a href='https://github.com/djadmin/vulnerable-app' target='_blank'>Click here to see the code.</a></p>\n<h4 id=\"what-could-possibly-go-wrong\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#what-could-possibly-go-wrong\" aria-label=\"what could possibly go wrong permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>What could possibly go wrong?</h4>\n<p>The talk ended with a live demonstration of an interesting and serious vulnerability found on a popular hiring platform, RecruiterBox.
