This also has additional benefits like enforcing common good practices across products, easier switching for developer across products and more. As part of the same endeavor, our Frontend team has been working hard on a Design System and a frontend boilerplate app over that. The boilerplate is something which any product at Wingify can simply fork and build a new frontend app, using the reusable components provided by the base Design System. More about the boilerplate and Design System later, but in this post want to specifically talk about a very import part of our Design System - <strong>our CSS</strong>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"issues-with-current-css\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#issues-with-current-css\" aria-label=\"issues with current css permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Issues with current CSS</h2>\n<p>First, why did we even start looking for a new way to write CSS? Previously, we were using a mix of <a href=\"http://getbem.com/introduction/\">BEM</a> and some helper classes. Occasional classes which belonged to neither of those two categories could be seen in the code base too! üòÖ This approach led to the following issues:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Naming classes was always a problem</strong> - Often, someone was commenting the pull requests that this class name doesn't make sense and should be changed to something more <em>\"meaningful\"</em>. Finding <em>\"meaningful\"</em> names is tough!</li>\n<li><strong>Unused CSS</strong> - Automated tools to detect unused CSS are not very reliable, especially with Single Page Apps. Our CSS kept growing over time and definitely one main reason for that was no one ever cared to remove the unused CSS.</li>\n<li><strong>Refactoring</strong> - With usual classes, it becomes difficult to refactor with confidence. Because the developer cannot be very sure about the class that they are renaming or removing getting used elsewhere which they are not aware of.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I have also blogged about these issues in detail in <a href=\"https://medium.freecodecamp.org/acss-a-dynamic-atomic-css-library-402dff9756e0\">an article here</a>.</p>\n<h2 id=\"evaluating-other-approaches\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#evaluating-other-approaches\" aria-label=\"evaluating other approaches permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Evaluating other approaches</h2>\n<p>Much before starting this mission, we started evaluating various frameworks for writing CSS. Our evaluation was based on following parameters:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Final output file size</li>\n<li>Rate of growth of file size over time</li>\n<li>Unused CSS handling</li>\n<li>Ease of learning for a new developer</li>\n<li>Ease of maintenance</li>\n<li>Documentation (existing or requirement to create one internally)</li>\n<li>Lintable</li>\n<li>Themable</li>\n<li>Ease of refactoring</li>\n<li>Naming effort involved</li>\n<li>Critical CSS generation</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Yeah, lots of parameters. We evaluated very critically üòÄ. Also, notice that I have kept the end-user performance related parameters on top as that's what mattered most to us.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-winner---acss\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-winner---acss\" aria-label=\"the winner   acss permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The winner - ACSS</h2>\n<p>We evaluated lots of known frameworks and libraries out there like pure BEM, Tachyons, Styled Components, Vue's scoped CSS, CSS modules. But We found that atomic CSS approach met most of our requirements as mentioned above. Also known as helper/utility classes approach, Atomic CSS requires no naming, documentation would be available if we go with a well-known library, its themable, lintable. Refactoring is also easier as all you need to do is remove classes from your HTML and never touch CSS.</p>\n<p>But even in various atomic CSS libraries available out there, we decided to go with <a href=\"https://acss.io/\">ACSS</a>(I know, the name is little too generic as they call themselves Atomic CSS!). We got introduced to ACSS by our resident UX engineer, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jitendravyas\">Jitendra Vyas</a>. Along with him, we discussed a lot of points about ACSS with one of the developers of ACSS, <a href=\"https://github.com/thierryk\">Thierry Koblentz</a>. ACSS was also mentioned by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/roderickhsiao/status/922620291527852032\">Addy Osmani at Google IO</a>.</p>\n<p>ACSS comes with very strong benefits which no other library had. You don't write CSS in ACSS, in fact you don't even download a CSS file and use in ACSS. ACSS comes with a tool called <a href=\"https://github.com/acss-io/atomizer\">Atomizer</a> which detects the use of ACSS classes in your HTML (or any file) and generates the corresponding CSS for those detected classes. Here is a sample HTML you would write with ACSS:</p>\n<p>{% highlight html %}\n<button class=\"Bgc(blue) C(white) P(10px) D(ib) Cur(p) Bgc(red):h\">\nI am a button\n</button>\n{% endhighlight %}</p>\n<p>On top of usual benefits of Atomic CSS approach, ACSS's automatic CSS generation means that we never get a single byte of CSS that we are not using in an app! What we use in HTML, lands in the final CSS file. In fact, ACSS generates such small CSS that it's practically possible to inline your complete CSS - i.e. your complete CSS can become your critical CSS!</p>\n<p>We were free from documentation as the only thing a developer needs to write ACSS is their <a href=\"https://acss.io/reference\">awesome, searchable reference</a>. There is also a <a href=\"https://github.com/acss-io/vscode-atomizer\">VSCode extension</a> which even removes the need for the reference. We were free from naming things of course.</p>\n<p>It may seem that a developer might have to write same set of classes repeatedly to create the same things, but that is not true. ACSS or any Atomic CSS approach requires a templating/component system where you can reuse a piece of HTML without duplicating. We use Vue.js to build our small reusable components.</p>\n<p>Of course they are some cons in ACSS, as well. For example, inside a particular component's HTML, you cannot find what any tag is about because there are no descriptive classes. This can be somewhat be fixed by using semantic tags. Basically, the pros are way too strong over its cons.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-end-result\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#the-end-result\" aria-label=\"the end result permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>The end result</h2>\n<p>We just finished porting a decent size app to our new system and guess what, our CSS reduced from <code class=\"language-text\">90 KB</code> to just <code class=\"language-text\">8 KB</code>! üò±</p>\n<p>That is all for this post! I encourage you to go and try out <a href=\"https://acss.io/\">ACSS</a> with an open mind and see if it solves your current CSS problem if any.
