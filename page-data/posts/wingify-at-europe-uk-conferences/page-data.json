It was a new experience for me as I got a chance to meet some great people and learn a lot from them.

I was one of the speakers and I talked about <a href=\"http://nodejsconf.it/talk/lets-talk-security/\">Node.js Security</a>.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    <img width=\"400\" height=\"300px\" src=\"/images/2016/12/nodeconfit.jpg\">\n</p>\nThe conference started with a keynote by Microsoft's Bryan Hughes ([@nebrius][11]) about the Node.js community and its evolution. He later introduced us to the Node.js foundation hierarchy and how it operates at various levels. Other speakers, too, touched various relevant and interesting topics including AsyncHooks, Load Balancing, and Deploying Node.js at scale. You can find more information at [http://nodejsconf.it/][18]\n<p>Speaker dinners were a great platform where I got to interact and network with fellow speakers. I also met <a href=\"https://github.com/feross10\">Feross</a> and I found him to be very humble and polite. He insisted on why fun side-projects are important and why you should keep doing them. And that‚Äôs why Wingify runs \"Show n Tell\" in which Wingifighters demonstrate and discuss any side projects that they are working on.</p>\n<p>I spent the rest of my time in Italy in traveling and had a wonderful experience. I fell in Love with Gelatosüç¶.</p>\n<h3 id=\"2-london-ajax-meetup-14th-november-2016\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#2-london-ajax-meetup-14th-november-2016\" aria-label=\"2 london ajax meetup 14th november 2016 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"https://www.meetup.com/halfstack/events/234651138/\">2) London Ajax Meetup (14th November 2016)</a></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/2016/12/meetup.jpg\">\n</p>\nThis is a monthly meetup that happens in London. This time the focus of the [meetup][2] was JavaScript Security and Neural Networks. I got a really good response after my talk. The venue was Skills Matter Office where a couple of other meetups were going on simultaneously. I realized this when I went into another arena searching for food and none of the people seemed to recognize me.\n<p>The other talk during the event was on \"Classifying Numbers as Odd or Even With Neural Networks,\" by Matt Zeunert. It was quite informative.</p>\n<h3 id=\"3-seleniumconf-uk-14th-16th-november-2016\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#3-seleniumconf-uk-14th-16th-november-2016\" aria-label=\"3 seleniumconf uk 14th 16th november 2016 permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a><a href=\"http://2016.seleniumconf.co.uk/\">3) SeleniumConf UK (14th-16th November 2016)</a></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    <img width=\"700\" height=\"350\" src=\"/images/2016/12/seleniumconf.png\">\n</p>\n[SeleniumConf][12] is an event focused on Web Testing and brings together Selenium developers and enthusiasts from around the world to share ideas, socialize, and work together on advancing the present and future success of the project.\n<p style=\"text-align: center;\">\n    <img src=\"/images/2016/12/talk.jpg\">\n</p>\n  My talk in this conference was about <b>Web Security and Efficient Penetration Testing</b>. I gave a <i>live demo</i> of my recent finding (security vulnerability) in InVision. With the help of [Burp Suite][16] and [BeEf][15], I demonstrated how a malicious comment in Invision App can be used to control browser and steal information.
