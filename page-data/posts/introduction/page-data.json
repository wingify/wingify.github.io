Three years down, we still end up\ndiscussing about the same things but at a completely different magnitude.\nThe customer base has increased to 2600+ accounts across 75+ countries and\nour <a href=\"http://visualwebsiteoptimizer.com/split-testing-blog/geo-distributed-architecture/\">geo distributed architecture</a>\non a set of 30+ servers currently serve close to 8,000 requests per second.</p>\n<p>In this amazing journey what we also managed to do is try our hands on a\nbunch of different technologies, tools and libraries. Many a times, the\navailable stuff didn't fit our scaling needs and we had to craft our own\nversions. With the medium of this blog (which was long due),\nmy team will try to talk about all the learning we keep\nhaving in our day-to-day engineering work at <a href=\"http://wingify.com\">Wingify</a>.</p>\n<p>In the next few posts, we will walk though the evolution in our\narchitecture (from standard LAMP to a delicately configured <a href=\"http://openresty.org\">openresty</a> CDN &#x26; DA (Content distribution &#x26; data acquisition\nnetwork) environment; from a single data center stack to a distributed\nsystem across the globe), code rewrites / refactors we had to do, various\nbenchmarks we relied on and of course all the learning we had from this\nexercise. We will showcase and write about the small / big tools and\nlibraries we wrote to scratch our own itch.</p>\n<p>If you ever have any question, suggestion, feedback or you want to discuss\nanything or just want to drop a hello; I would love to hear from you.
