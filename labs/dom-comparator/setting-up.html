## Setting Up

### Installation

* To install all the dependencies run `npm install`.
* Then run `bower install` for `jasmine`, `jquery` and `underscore` library dependencies.
* Install grunt globally, which is a Javascript Task Runner `npm install -g grunt-cli`.

### Running Tests

* For testing, we use Jasmine.
* Tests are written in the `test/unit` folder. Each file in the `src` directory have different test cases files associataed with them in the `test/unit` directory. The majority of the test cases that test the library as a black box are in `dom-comparator.spec.js`.
* To run tests, run `grunt; testem server;` (from the root directory of the repository)
* To see the final outputs open http://localhost:7357/ in the browser, open the JavaScript console and look for the `final_results` array.

### Cases which don't work
* If there are multiple occurrences of a node in the DOM. For example:

> `nodeA`:
```html
<div style="display: block;">
	<ul class="navigation vwo_1405423029796" style="cursor: auto; display: block;">
	</ul>
	<div class="clr">ORIGINAL TEXT</div>
</div>
```

> `nodeB`:
```html
<div class="clr">ORIGINAL TEXT</div>
<div style="display: block;">
	<ul class="navigation vwo_1405423029796" style="cursor: auto; display: INLINE;">
	</ul>
	<div class="clr">ORIGINAL TEXT</div>
</div>
```

> Here, since there are 2 occurrences of `<div class="clr">ORIGINAL TEXT</div>` in `nodeB`, the exact match of it cannot be found in `nodeA`, due to which the resulted output is not as expected.

* When the wrapping of the original node is changed. For example:

> `nodeA`:
```html
<div style="display: block;">
	<div class="clr">ORIGINAL TEXT</div>
</div>
```

> `nodeB`:
```html
<div>
	<div style="display: block;">
		<div class="clr">ORIGINAL TEXT</div>
	</div>
</div>
```

> Here, since the wrapping of `nodeB` is changed (wrapped by `<div> ... </div>`), the whole content in `nodeB` would be considered as inserted (because matching heirarchy is top to bottom).
