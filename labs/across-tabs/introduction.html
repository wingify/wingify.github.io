## Introduction

Easily communicate among browser tabs(supports cross-origin).

### Features

1. Safely enables [cross-origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Access_control_CORS) communication among different browser tabs. Uses `PostMessage` API for communication.
2. Easy to hook custom callback at various levels. Eg: executing a custom method in Child's tab on receiving a message from Parent tab.
3. Option to provide `data-tab-opener="name"` attribute on the target link/btn(which opens up a new tab), so that it remains disable until `Child` tab initiates a handshake and is received by the `Parent` tab
4. Fully fledged API to get information regarding the tabs(Parent and Child tabs) and other communication related methods.
5. Exports in a UMD format i.e. library works everywhere.


### Browser Support

Tested in Chrome, Firefox and IE(versions >= 9).


### Example

##### Create an instance / reference before using.

**Opener(Parent) tab**

```js
var config = {
  onHandshakeCallback: function () { ... },
  onPollingCallback: function () { ... }
}
var parent = new AcrossTabs.Parent(config);
```

**New(Child tab)**

```js
var config = {
  onReady: onReady,
  onInitialize: onInitialize,
  handshakeExpiryLimit: 4000, // msec
  onParentDisconnect: onParentDisconnect,
  onParentCommunication: onParentCommunication
};
var child =  new AcrossTabs.Child();
```

That's it! The communication setup would be set up once the new tab is opened up.
