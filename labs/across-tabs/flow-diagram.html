## Flow Diagram

* Opener/Parent tab(`P`) opens up a new Child tab(`C`).
* `C` initiates a handshake with the `P` tab by sending a `postMessage`.
* `P` acknowledges the request and sends `C` it's identity i.e. `UUID` along with `P` information.
* This sets up a communication channel between Parent and Child tab.
* Now, `P` and `C` can share custom messages with each other.
* Whenever `C` gets closed/refreshed, `P` is notified.
* Whenever `P` is closed/refreshed, all children of `P` tab gets notified.

**Explanation of diagram**

* Parent(`P`) opens CHild tab(`C1`) at `t=1`.
* `c1a` - When `C1` initiates a handshake with the Parent.
* `P1` - When `P` receives `C1` message.
* `P2` - `P` acknowledges the request and sends the `C1` its identity.
* `c1b` - When `C1` receives acknowledgemnet message along with identity from `P`.

* Parent(`P`) opens CHild tab(`C2`) at `t=10`.
* `c2a` - When `C2` initiates a handshake with the Parent.
* `P3` - When `P` receives `C2` message.
* `P4` - `P` acknowledges the request and sends the `C2` its identity.
* `c2b` - When `C2` receives acknowledgemnet message along with identity from `P`.

* `c1c` - Tab `C1` closes.
* `P5` - `P` is notified about the `C1`. Parent updates the list.
